Project 3 - Securing a Web Site (50 points)

This project involves some vulnerability discovery/forensics. We are providing you access to a web site, which runs on port 80 at 10.208.21.112 -- this is only accessible from within IIT Delhi. The underlying site has one or more vulnerabilities that I want you to discover, steal information that they leak, and fix. The project is a slight modification of a standard project associated with the text book. At various points, the information you can steal is listed as having extra points associated -- ignore those. If you reach those "secret” files -- I'll give you extra credit at the end of the project.



While not absolutely needed for this project, it would be a good learning exercise for you to run Paros (http://sourceforge.net/projects/paros/) or Nikto (http://www.cirt.net/nikto2). Both are open source "scanners” for web sites that can help you find vulnerabilities.



Turnin

You will turn in a short report (a single pdf file, saved with your entry number, e.g. 2011CSZ5645.pdf) with a bulleted list of vulnerabilities you found, information you can steal, and how the vulnerabilities can be fixed.
